# SaulColemans-Collection

## Description

This is a collection of files (small personal projects). It can be considered a portfolio of sorts, as it will include works to show off my abilities. I wanted somewhere to store all of my projects online, and somewhere I could access at any place at any time. In addition, I wanted to simply be able to give an employer (not exclusively an employer though) a link and have it go to, well, here. Somewhere that shows of what I have learned and done. I am also a programmer at heart- so I'm lazy. No need for me to search a hundred different places if it's all here!

## TOC (when this gets too long, I'll add one)

## Usage

As mentoined above, I plan to use this as a portfolio. It is also a personal space to store projects- and manage resources. A lot of the content is simply learning experiences. 

## Structure

-structure to be added soon :)-

## Credits

If I followed specific tutorials, I'll list them here. If I collaberate with anyone else, I'll also provide a link to their GitHub repo
